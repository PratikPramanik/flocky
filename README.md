# Flocky - open source group messaging

## Work in progress! More docs later

Based on Tropo for text messaging, Notifo for push notifications and CouchDB for persistence. This project exists to make it easy to deploy your own private group messaging service.

### Install! (if you are courageous enough to use pre-alpha software)

Get a Tropo account (free for testing)
Get a CouchDB somewhere on the internet
Configure the included ruby script to match your credentials
Use the included ruby script as a new Tropo scripting API application
